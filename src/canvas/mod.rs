//! WHATWG-shaped immediate-mode drawing surface.
//!
//! This module owns Canvas drawing, recording, image data, and pixel surfaces.
//! It is independent of a DOM, CSS engine, windowing system, or VM. An embedding
//! browser supplies CSS text parsing through [`CanvasSyntax`].
//!
//! [`Canvas`] exposes the common 2D context drawing operations.
//! [`RecordingCanvas`] captures [`DrawCmd`] values for replay;
//! [`TinySkiaCanvas`] paints them onto a `tiny_skia::Pixmap`.
//!
//! # Standalone usage
//!
//! ```
//! use webcanvas::canvas::{Canvas, TinySkiaCanvas, Color};
//! use tiny_skia::Pixmap;
//!
//! let mut pixmap = Pixmap::new(800, 600).unwrap();
//! {
//!     let mut canvas = TinySkiaCanvas::new(&mut pixmap);
//!     canvas.set_fill_color(Color::rgb(255, 0, 0));
//!     canvas.fill_rect(10.0, 10.0, 100.0, 100.0);

    // ─── Reading the drawing state back ─────────────────────────────────
    //
    // **Every attribute in §4.12.5 is readable, not only writable.** A page
    // does `const prev = ctx.fillStyle` before changing it, checks
    // `ctx.textAlign`, or serialises `ctx.font` — and until these existed this
    // trait had 27 setters and no way to ask any of them a question.
    //
    // Written once, as defaults over `drawing_state`, rather than twice as
    // overrides. Both implementations keep the same `DrawingState`, so the
    // recording and the rasteriser cannot drift into disagreeing about what an
    // attribute currently is or what its initial value was.

    // ─── CSS values, as the page wrote them ─────────────────────────────
    //
    // `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `font` and `shadowColor` are CSS values in
    // the IDL, and a page assigns them as text. These take that text and let

    // through, so `"rebeccapurple"`, `"color-mix(...)"` and every other form
    // the engine understands work here for free and cannot drift.
    //
    // The typed setters above stay: .NET's `System.Drawing` holds a `Color`
    // and a `Font`, not a string, and making it serialize one just so this
    // layer could parse it back would be a round trip that can only lose.
